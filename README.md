# Project Name
Crypto Tools

# Description
Provides basic crypto functionality including:
  - Conversion (base64 <-> hex <-> binary <-> ASCII)
  - Single-byte XOR encyrption
  - Single-byte XOR detection and decryption
  - Repeating key XOR encryption.
  - Frequency analysis using chi-squared scoring
 
 In progress:
  - Repeating key XOR detect/decrypt
  - AES-128-ECB encrypt
 
 Next:
  - AES-x-ECB encrypt/decrypt
  - AES-x-CBC encrypt/decrypt
